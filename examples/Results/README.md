# Results & Error Handling

This example shows how to use `Result`, in particular when you want to chain functions and return the first error if any occurs.

## Code

```roc
file:main.roc
```

## Output

Run this from the directory that has `main.roc` in it:

```sh
$ roc examples/Results/main.roc
```
