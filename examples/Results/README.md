# Results & Error Handling

This example shows how to use `Result` in functions that can return errors. In particular, we will see how to use `Result.try` or the try operator `?` to chain functions and return the first error if any occurs.

## Code

```roc
file:main.roc
```

## Output

Run this from the directory that has `main.roc` in it:

```sh
roc examples/Results/main.roc
```
